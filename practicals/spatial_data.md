Data bases
================
Christian König

**This practical exercise is a part of the workshop [Big Data
Ecology](https://github.com/ChrKoenig/Big_Data_Ecology)**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

This practical covers the fundamental concepts underlying Relational
Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and how those concepts are
abstracted in one of the most popular `R` packages, `dplyr`.

For the purpose of this practical, we will be working with the [Portal
Project Teaching
Database](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459),
which is a simplified version of the [Portal
Project](https://portal.weecology.org/) database. Follow the links and
make yourself familiar with the project.

Also, we will use the following packages:

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)
```

If you haven’t installed them, please do so with the following command:

``` r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "dbplyr"))
```
